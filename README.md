# **Setlist Builder CLI**

## Description:
This CLI is designed to take spotify playlists as input, capture and store metadata from songs in the playlist, and use this stored data to craft setlists for musical performances.

## Motivation:
As a performing musician myself, I have spent many hours crafting setlists by hand for various bars, weddings, and private events. Over the years, my bandmates and I developed rules for building setlists (what songs shouldn't go next to eachother, how to balance requests throughtout a setlist, etc.). Even still, making them by hand every time could take up to an hour per setlist, and reusing the same setlists from made us tired of those songs very quickly. I wanted to create a program that could follow the rules we had made for ourselves and reduce the time it took for us to make new setlists down to seconds.

I especially wanted the final product to be something that could be used by the average musician, whether they understood coding or not. To that end, I sought out to make a user-friendly setlist builder that could be used by the co-founder of my wedding band company (who has no coding experience whatsoever).
